## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Zero Code Testing** - No programming knowledge required, just record and replay
- 🎭 **Pixel-Perfect Replay** - Matches exact window size, viewport, and device pixel ratio
- ⚡ **Smart Element Location** - Multi-strategy selector with exponential backoff retry
- 🎠 **Carousel Support (Beta)** - Intelligent detection for Swiper, Slick, and Bootstrap carousels
- 🌊 **Human-Like Execution** - Replicates exact scroll speed, typing delays, and hover duration
- 🔄 **Intelligent Navigation** - Auto-correction and optimized back/forward navigation
- 🎨 **Beautiful CLI Output** - Real-time progress with color-coded status and timing
- 🧪 **Test-First Development** - 81 unit tests with comprehensive coverage
- 🔧 **TypeScript + Strict Mode** - Type-safe with ES2022 modules

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run a recorded test
node packages/cli/bin/saveaction.js run recording.json --headless false
```

## 📦 Architecture

```

├── packages/
│   ├── core/           # @saveaction/core - Execution engine
│   │   ├── parser/     # JSON recording parser + Zod validation
│   │   ├── runner/     # Test runner + element locator

```

## 🎮 CLI Commands

```bash
# Run recording with visible browser
saveaction run test.json --headless false

# Run with Firefox instead of Chromium
saveaction run test.json --browser firefox

# Adjust speed (0.5 = half speed, 2.0 = double speed)
saveaction run test.json --speed 0.5

# Record video of test execution
saveaction run test.json --video

# Custom timeout (milliseconds)
saveaction run test.json --timeout 60000
```

## 📊 Recording Format

Recordings are JSON files captured by the [SaveAction Recorder extension](https://github.com/rezwanahmedsami/SaveAction-recorder-browser-extenstion):

```json
{
  "id": "rec_1234567890",
  "testName": "User Login Flow",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "viewport": { "width": 1920, "height": 1080 },
  "windowSize": { "width": 1920, "height": 1188 },
  "devicePixelRatio": 1,
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "click",
      "timestamp": 1234,
      "completedAt": 1284,
      "selector": { "id": "login-button" },
      "coordinates": { "x": 120, "y": 45 }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎠 Carousel/Swiper Support (Beta)

SaveAction intelligently detects and handles carousel navigation to execute repeated clicks correctly.

### Supported Libraries

- ✅ **Swiper.js** - Detects `.swiper-button-next/prev` and `aria-label="Next slide"`
- ✅ **Bootstrap Carousel** - Detects `.carousel-control-next/prev`
- ✅ **Slick Carousel** - Detects `.slick-next/prev`

### How It Works

- **Timing-based detection**: Clicks >500ms apart are considered intentional navigation
- **Duplicate prevention**: Clicks <200ms apart are skipped as recording errors
- **Safety limits**: Maximum 5 consecutive carousel clicks to prevent infinite loops

### Example Output

```
🎠 Intentional carousel navigation click (767ms apart)
✅ [24] click completed (432ms)
🎠 Intentional carousel navigation click (696ms apart)
✅ [25] click completed (427ms)
```

### Known Limitations

- Custom carousel implementations may not be auto-detected
- International sites with non-English `aria-label` may need updates

**Feedback Welcome!** If your carousel isn't detected, please [open an issue](https://github.com/SaveActionHQ/SaveAction/issues) with your recording JSON.
